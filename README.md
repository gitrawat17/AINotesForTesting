> **Note:** For this tutorial, you will need an API key and tokens to evaluate closed-source models. Ensure you have:
> - An API key from the respective service provider (e.g., OpenAI).
> - Sufficient tokens or credits to make API calls and evaluate the models.
>
> You can obtain an API key by signing up on the provider's platform and following their instructions for API access. Make sure to review the pricing and usage limits to manage your costs effectively.
>
> Although we have covered a lot of open source examples as well, you need to practise with both Open source and closed source to learn well 


# How to Purchase OpenAI API Key Tokens and Create an API Key
